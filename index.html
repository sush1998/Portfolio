        <p>My name is Sushant Mahalle, and I am a aspiring Application Development Manager
with over 3 years of experience as System Analyst in banking and financial services industry,
specializing in back-office automation and software process improvement.Currently, I am
pursuing a Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) at Drexel University, where I
expect to graduate in 2026.</p>
        <p>During my time as an Application Support Analyst at Tata Consultancy Services, I led the
integration of technical support processes for new applications, improving first-contact resolution
by 35% and enhancing customer satisfaction by 20%. I also provided end-to-end support,
ensuring the seamless implementation and operation of applications for a range of clients. My
role involved collaborating with cross-functional teams to resolve technical incidents efficiently
and managing a high-volume ticketing system. As someone deeply interested in system
automation and optimization, I’ve developed a strong technical foundation through my academic
courses and professional experience.I’ve applied these skills in banking back-office operations,
where I worked on streamlining workflows and improving the production support for financial
applications. Academically, I am expanding my expertise in systems management, with
coursework including database management and web systems architecture. I have also gained
hands-on experience in web development through a fellowship with Crio.do, where I developed
responsive web applications using JavaScript, React, and CSS. My technical skill set includes
languages such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and SQL, alongside tools like ServiceNow,
Putty, CyberArk, Git, and GitHub.</p>
        <p>After graduation, I aim to take on a leadership role as an Application Development
Manager, where I can drive the development and deployment of innovative software solutions.
In the long term, I aspire to lead large-scale projects that leverage cutting-edge technologies to
streamline enterprise systems and deliver high-impact results.</p>
